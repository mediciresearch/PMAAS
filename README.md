# PMAAS - Product Mommy As A Service

### PMAAS is a one-stop shop to emulate a product mommy. Currently, this uses a custom LORA checkpoint, a custom upscaling pipeline, Stable Diffusion, and Whisper, to generate a video of an AI product mommy with a voiceover and captions for Youtube Shorts. 

This repository is being cleaned up. Until then, please refer to generate_youtube_short.py for the full product mommy video generation pipeline.
