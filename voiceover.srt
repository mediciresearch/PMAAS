1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,744
Did you know that the

2
00:00:01,744 --> 00:00:03,489
ancient Romans had a unique

3
00:00:03,489 --> 00:00:05,233
method for dental care that

4
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:06,978
sounds almost unbelievable by today's

5
00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:08,722
standards? Tucked away in the

6
00:00:08,722 --> 00:00:10,467
annals of obscure history lies

7
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:12,211
the fact that Romans, who

8
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:13,956
valued hygiene, actually had dentists

9
00:00:13,956 --> 00:00:15,701
and were one of the

10
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:17,445
first to use dental fillings.

11
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:19,190
But it's what they used

12
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,934
for mouthwash that will truly

13
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:22,679
astonish you. They believed that

14
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,423
Portuguese urine, due to its

15
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:26,168
hyamonia content, was exceptionally effective

16
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:27,913
for whitening teeth. So much

17
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:29,657
so that they would import

18
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:31,402
it specifically for this purpose,

19
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:33,146
the urine would be diluted

20
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:34,891
and used as a mouth

21
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:36,635
rinse to brighten their smiles.

22
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:38,380
This practice was so popular

23
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,124
that it became a profitable

24
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,869
trade, and the Roman Emperor

25
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:43,614
Nero even levied attacks on

26
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:45,358
the imported urine. Imagine that,

27
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:47,103
a world where urine wasn't

28
00:00:47,103 --> 00:00:48,847
waste, but a valued commodity

29
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:50,592
for daily personal care. This

30
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,336
peculiar fact is a testament

31
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,081
to how cultural practices and

32
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:55,826
perceptions can drastically differ through

33
00:00:55,826 --> 00:00:57,570
history, challenging what we consider

34
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,315
normal or even discoverable in

35
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:00,013
our time.
