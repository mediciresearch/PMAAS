00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,874
Hey there, curious minds! Ever

2
00:00:01,874 --> 00:00:03,749
heard of the eerie catacombs

3
00:00:03,749 --> 00:00:05,623
beneath Paris? Well, beneath the

4
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:07,498
buzzing city streets lies a

5
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:09,372
silent maze of tunnels with

6
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:11,247
a spine-chilling history. These catacombs

7
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:13,122
hold the remains of over

8
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:14,996
six million people. That's right,

9
00:00:14,996 --> 00:00:16,871
six million. They were created

10
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:18,745
in the late 18th century

11
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:20,620
to tackle the issue of

12
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,495
overcrowded cemeteries that were causing

13
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:24,369
serious health issues. Now, that

14
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:26,244
meant transferring bones from these

15
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:28,118
overflowing graveyards covertly at night

16
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:29,993
to avoid public panic and

17
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:31,868
outrage. And here's where it

18
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:33,742
gets really bizarre. Some of

19
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,617
these old tunnels have been

20
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:37,491
forgotten with time, leading to

21
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:39,366
legends of people wandering in,

22
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:41,241
and never finding their way

23
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,115
out. What's more, during World

24
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:44,990
War II, the French resistance

25
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,864
used these tunnels to hide

26
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:48,739
from the Nazis, who, by

27
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:50,614
the way, also built their

28
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:52,488
own bunkers down there. So

29
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:54,363
next time you're walking the

30
00:00:54,363 --> 00:00:56,237
romantic streets of Paris, just

31
00:00:56,237 --> 00:00:58,112
remember the haunting history that

32
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,987
lies just beneath your feet.
